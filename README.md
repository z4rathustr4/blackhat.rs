# blackhat.rs
- I'm following the book **Black Hat Rust** by **Sylvain Kerkour**.
- **Check out the book [here](https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust-week-2021)**
-----
- Will be pushing every code example as I dig into the chapters, maybe with some changes if I feel like doing it
- ~Every tool that is developed throughout the book will be on a different branch in this repo.~
- Every tool will be on a separate directory and every chapter will have its own directory with the provided expamples.

#### Changelog:
- [x] Chapter 01
- [ ] Chapter 02 [In progress]
